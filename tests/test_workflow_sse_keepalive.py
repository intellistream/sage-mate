"""Regression tests for the Chat Latency Optimizations Task 4 SSE keepalive.

When the chat workflow is in-flight, the LLM stage may not emit a trace
step for tens of seconds. Without a heartbeat, Cloudflare's idle proxy
timeout (~100s on the free plan) can drop the ``/chat/workflow-events``
SSE connection mid-answer. Task 4 ensures the broker emits a typed
``{"type": "keepalive"}`` event every ``CHAT_SSE_KEEPALIVE_SECONDS`` so
the connection stays warm.
