"""Regression tests for the post-answer background-execution split.

Task 2 of the Chat Latency Optimizations plan moves the four post-answer
fan-out stages (`memory_persist`, `memory_profile_consolidate`,
`follow_up_plan`, `memory_usefulness_score`) off the critical path. With
``DIGITAL_TWIN_POST_ANSWER_BACKGROUND=true`` (default) and a trace callback
attached, ``service.answer`` returns the rendered ``ChatResponse``
immediately after ``response_render`` and runs the post-answer side-effects
on a background ``asyncio.create_task`` instead of blocking the HTTP
response.
